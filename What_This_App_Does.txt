GenAI Energy Trading Assistant – What It Does (UK Version)

This assistant helps UK energy trading teams make smarter, faster decisions using AI to analyse power market data, forecasts, regulations, and contracts.

Here’s what it does step-by-step:

1. Market Summary
You upload data from UK electricity markets (like EPEX SPOT or market prices from NGESO).
The app summarises:
- Are prices trending up or down?
- Are there any grid constraints?

2. Forecast vs Actual Generation
You upload forecasted and actual generation data.
The app highlights:
- Where your forecasts were off
- How much you over- or under-generated
- Possible reasons (e.g., weather variation, outages)

3. Regulatory Updates
Upload bulletins from Ofgem, NGESO, or BEIS.
The app explains:
- What the regulation means
- Who it impacts (generator, supplier, aggregator)
- What you should do about it

4. Trade Log Review
Upload logs of past trades or imbalance settlement data.
The app identifies:
- Missed profit opportunities
- Best price bands and settlement windows
- Trends across trading days

5. Trading Suggestions
Based on demand forecasts and real-time market trends, the app suggests:
- When and how much to buy/sell
- Optimal bid prices and settlement zones
- Which generation asset to dispatch

6. Contract Analysis
Upload your Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or supplier contracts.
The app pulls out:
- Key dates
- Penalty clauses
- Volume obligations and flexibility rules
